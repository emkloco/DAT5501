UK Immigration & GDP Data Visualization

This project provides a data visualization exploring the relationship between the UK's immigrant population and its GDP per capita from 1990 to 2023.

The script processes and plots the data, highlighting the correlation and annotating key economic events like the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic.

Contents:

emeka_immigration_vs_gdp.py: The Python script that uses pandas and matplotlib to generate the visualization.

immigration_gdp_data.csv: The source data for the project.

UK Immigrant Population vs. GDP Per Capita (1990-2023).png: The final chart produced by the script.



To Run:

Ensure the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, scipy) are installed.

Execute the script from your terminal:
python emeka_immigration_vs_gdp.py

The script will generate and display the chart. The CSV data file must be in the same directory.
