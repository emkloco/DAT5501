# Economic Correlation Analysis: UK Immigration vs. GDP

## Overview
This project utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to investigate the correlation between the UK's immigrant population and GDP per Capita from 1990 to 2023. It aims to visualize demographic shifts alongside economic output.

## Key Features
- **Dual-Axis Visualization:** Plots two distinct scales (Population vs. Currency) on a single timeline for direct comparison.
- **Data Storytelling:** Annotates significant economic events (2008 Financial Crisis, COVID-19 Pandemic) to provide context to the data.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$) and $R^2$ values to quantify the relationship.

## Files
- `emeka_immigration_vs_gdp.py`: The analysis script that processes the CSV and generates the dual-axis chart.
- `immigration_gdp_data.csv`: Source dataset containing population and GDP figures.
- `Immigrant_vs_gdp.png`: The final annotated visualization.

## Usage
Run the script to generate the visualization and print statistical stats:

```bash
python emeka_immigration_vs_gdp.py
