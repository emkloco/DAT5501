## Overview
This repository contains my portfolio for the **DAT5501: Analysis, Software and Career Practice** module. It demonstrates the technical skills and professional workflows I have developed during this module, ranging from statistical forecasting to automated software testing.

The portfolio is structured as a collection of modular projects, each addressing specific data analysis challenges or software engineering principles.

## Portfolio Highlights

I have organised the work into specific skill-based directories:

| Project | Key Skills Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[US Election Analysis](./Pandas_election_analysis_activity)** | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Pandas grouping & aggregation, Large dataset processing. |
| **[Global Inequality Forecasting](./Fitting_and_forecasting_activity)** | Polynomial Regression, Model Selection (BIC/Chi-Squared), Bias-Variance Tradeoff. |
| **[UK Economic Correlation](./Presentation_data_visualisation)** | Data Storytelling, Dual-Axis Visualisation, Statistical Correlation ($R^2$). |
| **[Date Duration Calculator](./Duration_calculator_unit_testing)** | Date/Time Vectorization (NumPy), Input Validation, Unit Testing time-series logic. |
| **[Gold Price Algorithm Analysis](./Daily_price_changes_sorting_activity)** | Empirically validating Big-O time complexity using real-world financial data. |
| **[Car Safety Classification](./Decision_tree_optimisations)** | Machine Learning, Hyperparameter Optimization, Decision Trees. |
| **[Financial Modelling](./Interest_calculator_unit_testing)** | Test-Driven Development (TDD), Mathematical Modelling, Edge-case handling. |
| **[Automated Data Pipeline](./CircleCI)** | CI/CD principles, Synthetic Data Generation, Automated Regression Testing. |
