## Project Overview
This portfolio demonstrates advanced data analysis, visualization, and software engineering practices developed during the DAT5501 module. It includes statistical modeling of global inequality, economic correlation analysis, and algorithmic complexity benchmarking.

## Portfolio Highlights

### 1. Global Inequality Forecasting
**Key Skills:** Polynomial Regression, BIC/Chi-Squared Model Selection.
- Analyzed historical Gini index data (1820-1990).
- Implemented a model selection pipeline to identify overfitting vs. underfitting.
- **Outcome:** Determined that an Order-5 polynomial provides the optimal balance of bias and variance.

### 2. Economic Correlation Analysis (UK)
**Key Skills:** Data Storytelling, Dual-Axis Visualization (Matplotlib).
- Correlated UK Immigration statistics with GDP per Capita.
- Annotated key economic events (2008 Crisis, COVID-19).
- **Outcome:** Strong positive correlation ($R^2 = 0.74$) observed.

### 3. Algorithmic Complexity Benchmarking
**Key Skills:** Algorithm Analysis, Big-O Notation.
- Benchmarked sorting algorithms against real-world Gold Price volatility data.
- Validated $O(n \log n)$ complexity empirically.
