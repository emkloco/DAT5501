Unit Testing Activity

A straightforward example of a Python function with its corresponding unit tests.

I wrote a basic addition function, then built a test suite using Python's built-in unittest framework to validate its behavior with integers and floats.

Content:

milan_function.py: The script defining the core function. It adds two numbers and includes basic type checking.
milan_function_unit_test.py: The test script. It runs a series of assertions to confirm the function returns the correct sums for different numeric inputs.

To run:

No special libraries are needed; unittest is part of the standard library.

Run the test script from your terminal:
python milan_function_unit_test.py

The tests will execute and print the results to the console.
